# Cocktail-Shaker-Sort

- Variation of the bubble sort method
- Uses a DLL class in order to traverse through file
- Once list is imported to a DLL, main.cpp sorts through left to right, and then right to left
- Each pass increments and decrements the starting/beginning, as the ends get sorted
- Each pass also checks if something was swapped, otherwise it will break out and complete
